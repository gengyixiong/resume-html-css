Syracuse University (2013-2015):
Master of Science in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering

Beijing Institute of Technology (2009-2013):
Bachelor of Science in Engineering Mechanics

EXPERIENCE
1. Cytoskeleton Modeling and Analysis: I got hundreds of immunofluorescent images of different shapes and areas of cells using confocal laser scanning microscope. Then I programmed to analyze the distinct and reliable geometric parameters of cell nucleus and cytoskeletons. As a result, area, perimeter, circularity, angle of cell nucleus, actin area ratio, actin number, actin distribution of cytoskeleton are determined.
2. VPN and Shadowsocks Service Provider: Two VPN servers, located in Los Angeles and New York, are being provided by me to protect online privacy of users. I shared 20 public keys for free to keep users from Internet censorship (A single public key can be used by multi-users at the same time). My service supports Windows, Apple Mac, Linux, iOS and Android platforms.
3. Android Development: System control enhancement and productivity enhancement apps. Familiar with UI design, Intent, SQLite, multimedia, graphics and animation, et cetera.
4. Arduino and Raspberry Pi Development: Arduino robot and Raspberry Pi based smart TV. I am good at hardware development and familiar with GPIO (general purpose input output). Python and Processing languages were often used.
5. MATLAB: As an engineering student, I almost work with MATLAB every day, experiment data processing, mathematical calculation. I also have experience with GUI and Simulink toolbox.

AWARD
RvD IDEA Awards: My project, SMART SEX STIMULATION DEVICE, was very competitive, I gave a presentation in final round and was interviewed by four potential investors. I was offered an opportunity to win up to $10,000.
